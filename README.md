# Star Wars Search Application

This is a tool that allows users to search the Star Wars API(SWAPI) for Star Wars characters by name and filter the returned results by gender.

### Current Issues

* The gender filter still requires some programming to work correctly.

* If there is only one result returned, the language reads "1 Results". Need to add a conditional to fix that.
